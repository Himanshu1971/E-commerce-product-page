# E-commerce Product Page
### Project Description
This project is a simple yet elegant e-commerce product page designed to showcase a pair of running shoes. The page is built using HTML and CSS, with a focus on responsiveness to ensure it provides a great user experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: The page layout adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, providing a seamless browsing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Product Display**: A visually appealing product section that includes:
- **Product Image**: A high-quality image of the running shoes.
- **Product Details**: The name, price, and a detailed description of the product.
- **Purchase Options**: Users can select the size and quantity of the shoes they wish to purchase.
- **Add to Cart**: A functional button that allows users to add the selected product to their cart (button functionality is demonstrated but not implemented in terms of backend logic).
### Technical Specifications
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page, organizing the header, main content, and footer.
- **CSS**: Styles the page, enhancing the visual appeal and ensuring responsiveness through media queries.
### Usage

### Customization
The page can be easily customized:

- **Product Image**: Replace the shoe.jpg file with your own image file.
- **Product Details**: Modify the text in the HTML file to change the product name, price, and description.
